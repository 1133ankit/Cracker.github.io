Introduction Delhi Metro is a rapid transit system serving Delhi and its satellite cities in the National Capital Region of India. As of now, there are a total of 229 metro stations including the Airport Express stations. The first section of the Delhi Metro opened on 25 December 2002 with the Red Line,[2] and has since been expanded to around 347.66 km(216.03 miles) of route length as of 4 October 2019. The network has nine operational lines and is built and operated by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC). The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation makes 2,700 trips per day carrying 1.5 million passengers, who on an average travel a distance of 17 kilometres each.

For this project, we will try to look at the places surrounding these metro stations and classify them accordng to the similarity of nearby venues. Every one use metro transit to migrate from one place to another for reasons which can be personal of professional. If there are more professional places like companies, offices surrounding a station then it will mostly be used by working professionals. Then there are some stations with many unversities or colleges nearby and is used by Students mostly. Stations which have places like amusement parks, malls, monuments are used by people for recreation.

We can classify stations by primary usage analyzing the data that contains the number of nearby venues according to their category. This can help plan further extension of the network and find places for new development.
Data In this section we will describe our base data which we will analyze to reach the goal we want.
